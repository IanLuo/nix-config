 * commands from a specific source (e.g., built-in code, local files).
 *
 * The CommandService is responsible for invoking these loaders, aggregating their
 * results, and resolving any name conflicts. This architecture allows the command
 * system to be extended with new sources without modifying the service itself.

     * name conflicts for extension commands by renaming them, and then returns a
     * fully constructed `CommandService` instance.
     *
     * Conflict resolution:
     * - Extension commands that conflict with existing commands are renamed to
     *   `extensionName.commandName`
     * - Non-extension commands (built-in, user, project) override earlier commands
     *   with the same name based on loader order

     *   interface. Built-in commands should come first, followed by FileCommandLoader.
     * @param signal An AbortSignal to cancel the loading process.
     * @returns A promise that resolves to a new, fully initialized `CommandService` instance.
